            <p>ðŸ§¬ Our Services
              At the intersection of innovation and precision, our suite of genomic services is crafted to empower both pioneering research and clinical diagnostics. Each service reflects our commitment to scientific excellence, accuracy, and personalized collaboration.
              
              I. Research Projects
              In service of scientific discovery, we offer robust analytical frameworks designed to unveil the hidden patterns within complex biological data.
              
              1. Transcriptome Analysis
              Delve into the dynamic landscape of gene expression. Our transcriptomic analysis reveals the molecular choreography of biological systems â€” illuminating differentially expressed genes, pathway activity, and regulatory networks with precision.
              
              2. Metagenomics Analysis
              Explore the unseen biodiversity within environmental or clinical samples. We reconstruct microbial ecosystems, providing taxonomic profiling, functional annotation, and ecological insights through comprehensive metagenomic pipelines.
              
              3. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Analysis
              Combat the global challenge of drug resistance. Our AMR analysis detects resistance determinants across diverse samples, equipping researchers with actionable insights into pathogen susceptibility and resistance evolution.
              
              4. Bacterial Whole Genome Sequencing
              From blueprint to biological insight â€” we offer high-fidelity bacterial genome assemblies, annotation, and comparative genomic analysis to support epidemiology, evolution, and functional genomics research.
              
              II. Diagnostic Projects
              In the pursuit of clinical clarity, we bring together genomics and medicine with purpose and precision. Our diagnostic offerings empower healthcare professionals with data that informs decisions, not just results.
              
              1. Somatic Tumor Analysis
              Uncover the mutational signatures that shape cancer. Our somatic variant analysis identifies driver mutations, structural rearrangements, and actionable alterations across the tumor genome, guiding precision oncology.
              
              2. Germline Analysis with Phenotypic Correlation
              We integrate patient phenotype with genomic data to uncover inherited variants of clinical relevance. Using stringent interpretative frameworks and expert curation, we deliver reports that bridge the gap between sequence and significance.
              
              3. Panel Screening
              Designed for speed, specificity, and clinical impact â€” our targeted panel screening supports diagnosis of inherited disorders, carrier detection, and predictive testing with unparalleled accuracy andÂ sensitivity.</p>
