              <h3>Our Services</h3> 
              <ul>At the intersection of innovation and precision, our suite of genomic services is crafted to empower both pioneering research and clinical diagnostics. Each service reflects our commitment to scientific excellence, accuracy, and personalized collaboration.
              </ul>
        <h3>Research Projects</h3> 
              <ul>In service of scientific discovery, we offer robust analytical frameworks designed to unveil the hidden patterns within complex biological data.
              </ul>
        <h3>Transcriptome Analysis</h3> 
              <ul>Delve into the dynamic landscape of gene expression. Our transcriptomic analysis reveals the molecular choreography of biological systems — illuminating differentially expressed genes, pathway activity, and regulatory networks with precision.
              </ul>
        <h3>Metagenomics Analysis</h3> 
              <ul>Explore the unseen biodiversity within environmental or clinical samples. We reconstruct microbial ecosystems, providing taxonomic profiling, functional annotation, and ecological insights through comprehensive metagenomic pipelines.
              </ul>
        <h3>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Analysis</h3> 
              <ul>Combat the global challenge of drug resistance. Our AMR analysis detects resistance determinants across diverse samples, equipping researchers with actionable insights into pathogen susceptibility and resistance evolution.
              </ul>
        <h3>Bacterial Whole Genome Sequencing</h3> 
              <ul>From blueprint to biological insight — we offer high-fidelity bacterial genome assemblies, annotation, and comparative genomic analysis to support epidemiology, evolution, and functional genomics research.
              </ul>
        <h3>Diagnostic Projects</h3> 
              <ul>In the pursuit of clinical clarity, we bring together genomics and medicine with purpose and precision. Our diagnostic offerings empower healthcare professionals with data that informs decisions, not just results.
              </ul>
        <h3>Somatic Tumor Analysis</h3> 
              <ul>Uncover the mutational signatures that shape cancer. Our somatic variant analysis identifies driver mutations, structural rearrangements, and actionable alterations across the tumor genome, guiding precision oncology.
              </ul>
        <h3>Germline Analysis with Phenotypic Correlation</h3> 
              <ul>We integrate patient phenotype with genomic data to uncover inherited variants of clinical relevance. Using stringent interpretative frameworks and expert curation, we deliver reports that bridge the gap between sequence and significance.
              </ul>
        <h3>Panel Screening</h3> 
              <ul>Designed for speed, specificity, and clinical impact — our targeted panel screening supports diagnosis of inherited disorders, carrier detection, and predictive testing with unparalleled accuracy and sensitivity.
